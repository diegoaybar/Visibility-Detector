# Tab Focus Alarm

A simple yet effective full-screen webpage that alerts you when you switch tabs, windows, or minimize the browser, perfect for staying focused.

- **Full-screen design**: Takes up the entire browser window for maximum visibility
- **Dynamic background**: Green when focused, red when unfocused
- **Audio alert**: Plays a beep sound when focus is lost
- **Smooth transitions**: Color changes with a subtle animation effect
- **Dual detection**: Uses `visibilitychange` and `focus/blur` events for reliability

## Features
- Changes background to green when the page is visible or focused
- Switches to red and plays an alarm sound when:
  - You switch tabs
  - You switch windows
  - The browser is minimized
- Includes a smooth color transition for a polished look
- Uses a public domain beep sound (customizable with any audio URL)

## How to Use
1. Save the code as `index.html`, `styles.css` & `script.js`.
2. Open it in a web browser.
3. Switch tabs, windows, or minimize the browser to see and hear the effect.

## Notes
- Requires an internet connection to load the alarm sound
- Some browsers may block autoplay audio until the page is interacted with
- Replace the audio URL with your preferred sound file if desired
- Host the page on a server (local or online) for audio to work due to browser security restrictions
