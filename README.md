This code performs the following actions:

1. Creates a full-screen webpage.
2. Changes the background to green when the page is visible or focused.
3. Changes the background to red and plays an alarm sound when:
    - The tab is switched.
    - The window is switched.
    - The browser is minimized.
4. Utilizes both `visibilitychange` and `focus/blur` events for enhanced detection.
5. Includes a smooth color transition effect.
6. Uses a simple beep sound from a public domain source (you can replace it with any audio URL).

To use this code:

1. Save it as `index.html`.
2. Open it in a web browser.
3. Switch tabs or windows to observe the effect.

Notes:
- The alarm sound requires an internet connection to load the audio file.
- Some browsers might block autoplay audio until the page is interacted with.
- You can replace the audio URL with any other sound file you prefer.
- The page needs to be hosted on a server (local or online) for the audio to work properly due to browser security restrictions.
